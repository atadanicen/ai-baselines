Swift4RL is an open source organization that explores new way of working with Reinforcement Learning combining [Swift for TensorFlow (S4TF)](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift), [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) and possibly other environments in the future. Python has been the main programming language 
for data scientist for so long eventhough it has some drawbacks such as being slow, concurrency (GIL), and relying on native bindings for wiring Python with C++ and CUDA for resource intensive applications. On the other hand [Swift for Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift) provides easy way to write custom ops, debugging, aesthetics and design which allows power users like AI researches to become productive.  Another advantage of Swift is that it's been built for mobile devices. Therefore it is pretty lightweight. Wouldn't it be awesome to train baseline models by taking advantage of Unity's physic engine and deploy them on the real world mobile robots.
